# ðŸŽ® CritterDrop â€” A Pixel Critter Vending Game

CritterDrop is a whimsical collectible game built with **React** and **TypeScript**, featuring animated pixel critters, rarity-based reveals, and retro arcade visuals.

ðŸ§© **Built With**  
- React + TypeScript  
- Custom CSS + Tailwind-style utilities  
- Figma Make for pixel planning  
- Radix UI (optional primitives)  
- React Testing Library for unit tests

ðŸŽ¯ **Educational Value**
